# Honda Mobility Hacks: InsurCent

<img src="content/hack_header.jpg" alt="Banner from Honda Mobility Hacks event"/>

Honda Mobility held a hackathon at Ann Arbor SPARK at the beginning of 2019. Teams were given access to data collected from autonomous vehicles and tasked with coming up with a novel use for it. Three other participants and I formed a team as the event started, having never worked together before, and our submission was awarded first place by the judges!

## Our Idea
### Can we incentivize drivers to user safer routes by gamifying insurance discounts?

## Our Approach
We started by independently researching and brainstorming ideas and presenting them to the team. We provided feedback, compared and contrasted our ideas, and finally scored them in terms of originality, difficulty (to implement), and customer value. Through this process, we identified some overlap in the interests of drivers, insurance companies, and pedestrians/the general public. With an initial idea in mind, we set about refining it further and searching for complementary third-party data, ultimately incorporating the MapQuest API. With our idea and data identified we iteratively explored the data including the MapQuest API using both JavaScript and Python and built up a proof of concept to showcase the feasibility and value of our idea: InsurCent.
